```

## Task 1
Generate a noisy dataset with a line and detet the line using RANSAC algorithm
actuation
- Generate a 2D dataset with a noisy line (using e.g. Gauss noise or a noise of another distribution)
- Create a code in Python (or use an existing library) that detects the line parameters (e.g., a and b coefficients of y = ax + b line model) using RANSAC algorithm
- Visualize the RANSAC-based line detection

## Task 2
Detect & visualize an object from 3D point cloud by eliminating the environment,
and estimate the distance to the object (the minimal depth measurement)
- Record (Download or Generate) indoor 3D sensor dataset in a room environment with an object (tips: you can measure a real 3D Kinect/3D LIDAR dataset at the robotics lab, or find a 3D Kinect/3D LIDAR dataset in the Internet, or Simulate your own dataset in a Robotic Simulator, e.g. Gazebo/ROS, Webots, CoppeliaSim, or just model the noisy 3D point cloud indoor environment with an object in Python)
- Detect & Remove the redundant 3D point clouds that belong to environment (e.g. by filtering the depth with setting the reasonable thresholds on minimal and maximal range)
- Detect & Remove the redundant 3D point clouds that belong to a floor (using a plane detector based on RANSAC)
- Mark the object in the 3D point cloud (changing the objectâ€™s color), and estimate the distance to the object (the minimal depth)

## Description:
This Assignment is run by a single notebook file ```main.ipynb``` in the main folder.


### Local Setup

* Clone project using link:
```angular2html
https://github.com/syedjameel/SPA-Assignment-4.git
```

### How to Run

1. Run the following command to navigate to the directory using:

   ```shell
   cd SPA-Assignment-4/ 
   ```
2. Run the following command to install dependent libraries:

   ```shell
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Finally, Run the ```main.ipynb``` file [In ```Jupyter notebook``` or ```colab```]
